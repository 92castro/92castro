### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I recently graduated from the University of Denver with a Certificate in Full Stack Development and I'm eager to bring my skills and passion to the industry. In addition to my technical skills, I have strong problem-solving and communication abilities, which I honed through various team projects during my studies. I am a quick learner and able to work well under pressure. I believe my technical skills, combined with my positive attitude, and eagerness to learn, will make me a valuable addition to any development team.
